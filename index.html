            A tribute to great Aaryabhatta
        </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Aaryabhatta was a great mathematician who contributed in many area in his whole life. He gave world the power to start counting. Aryabhata became famous as a mathematician and astronomer. In his only surviving work, Aryabhatiya, he covered a wide range of topics, such as extracting square roots, solving quadratic equations, and predicting eclipses. </p>

            Aryabhata, also called Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder, (born 476, possibly Ashmaka or Kusumapura, India), astronomer and the earliest Indian mathematician whose work and history are available to modern scholars. He is also known as Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder to distinguish him from a 10th-century Indian mathematician of the same name. He flourished in Kusumapura—near Patalipurta (Patna), then the capital of the Gupta dynasty—where he composed at least two works, Aryabhatiya (c. 499) and the now lost Aryabhatasiddhanta.

                Most noteworthy is that Aryabhatta correctly founded that the earth rotates on its axis. Furthermore, he also proposed the geocentric model of the solar system which described the earth to be the center of the universe. And the sun, the moon, and the planets revolve around it.

                Aryabhata also explained the solar and lunar eclipses in his book. Consequently, he also proposed that the moon due to the reflection of the sunlight. He explained in his book that the lunar eclipse and the solar eclipse takes by the shadow-casting of the earth and the moon.

                In conclusion Aryabhatta approximations in the field of astronomy were quite accurate. It provided the core to the computational paradigm which provides a base to the modern theories.
